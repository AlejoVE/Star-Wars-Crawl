# CSS-Star-Wars-crawl-menu

This was a group project (made in pair-coding with [Alejandro Montilla](https://github.com/AlejoVE)) carried out on the 18th of January 2021 as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to make the famous opening crawling text from the Star Wars franchise.

## Learning objectives

- [ ] Improve our CSS' positioning skills
- [ ] Learn more about CSS properties
- [ ] Learn the basics of CSS' animations
- [ ] Work in pair-programming

## The end result expected was:

## Our method:

Step 1 was putting the text in the middle of the screen and, using animations and perspective, making it crawl to the infinity and beyond. We put simple placeholder text in lieu of the description. Step 2 was adding a starry sky backgroung, the introductory text "A long time ago..." and displaying the BeCode logo.
